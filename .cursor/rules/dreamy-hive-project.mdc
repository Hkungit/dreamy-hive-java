# Dreamy Hive Project Guide

This project is a Java monolithic web application combining an e-commerce mall and a user community, inspired by "得物". It is for learning and practice purposes only.

## Key Documentation
- [开发文档](mdc:doc/dreamy hive开发文档.md): Full project overview, module breakdown, API design, backend/frontend structure, and development flow.
- [数据库设计](mdc:doc/db设计.md): Complete SQL schema for all tables (users, products, orders, community, etc.).
- [开发 TODO](mdc:TODO.md): Up-to-date checklist of all major features and development phases.

## Project Structure
- Backend: Java (Spring Boot 3.x, MyBatis/MyBatis Plus, MySQL 8.x, Lombok)
- Frontend: Vue 3 + Element Plus (see frontend repo if available)
- Key backend directories: `controller/`, `service/`, `mapper/`, `entity/`, `dto/`, `vo/`, `config/`, `common/`
- See [开发文档](mdc:doc/dreamy hive开发文档.md) for a detailed directory tree.

## Database Design
- All main tables and fields are defined in [数据库设计](mdc:doc/db设计.md).
- Includes: user, category, attribute, spu, sku, product_image, address, order, order_detail, post, comment, like.
- Use this as the source of truth for entity/model creation.

## API Endpoints
- RESTful API for both user and admin modules.
- User: product browsing, cart, order, community (posts/comments/likes), authentication.
- Admin: product/category/SKU management, order management, post/comment moderation, statistics.
- See [开发文档](mdc:doc/dreamy hive开发文档.md) for full endpoint tables and descriptions.

## Development TODOs
- Track progress and next steps in [开发 TODO](mdc:TODO.md).
- Tasks are split by user/admin modules and by development phase.
- Use this to coordinate work and check off completed features.

## Contribution Guide
- Start by reading [开发文档](mdc:doc/dreamy hive开发文档.md) for architecture and conventions.
- Reference [数据库设计](mdc:doc/db设计.md) when working on entities, mappers, or database migrations.
- Update [开发 TODO](mdc:TODO.md) as you complete features or fix bugs.
